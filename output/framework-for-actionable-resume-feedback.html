	<h1 class="post-title">Framework for Actionable Resume Feedback</h1>
	<span class="post-date">Sat 30 November 2024</span>
	<p>Improving a resume can create opportunities and result in 6 figure differences in total compensation for software engineers. A resume signals competence at solving an employers' problems, but not everyone has the work history suited for their desired career. By creating levels of criteria for a resume, one can understand an applicants' current position and which edits open opportunities. The post explores a framework for framing content and does not advise on content for a resume. I have software engineering expertise, but the principles apply to any career path.</p>
<h4>Level 0 - Readability</h4>
<p>Mistakes here will raise red flags with human and automated evaluations. A resume is readable if it is organized, consistent, and without any obvious writing errors. </p>
<h4>Level 1 - Basics</h4>
<p>A resume requires contact information, work history, accomplishments and career specific info. For a software engineer, it's specific technical proficiencies and keywords. With the correct keywords, an applicant passes automated filters. At this level, a human reviewer will understand the facts but not the value of the work.</p>
<h4>Level 2 - Impact</h4>
<p>Level 2 shows an understanding what is important to the business. Generally, impact can be found in the format <code>I had result X by doing Y</code>. The closer the <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> are to solving an employers problem, the more convincing resume. Understanding the reasoning for a project is difficult after leaving a company, so remember to record the impact while working.</p>
<h4>Level 3 - Details and Context</h4>
<p>Ambiguous and relational words signal an opportunity to showcase various skills to an employer. Here are examples not matching level 3's criteria.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Improved application on mobile devices with a mobile UI overhaul for job applications in React</li>
<li>Optimized the CI/CD process for faster build times</li>
<li>Led the development of a real time chat feature securing a customer contract</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>With examples 1 and 2, an applicant seems to have technical skills with build processes and frontend development but the words <code>improved</code> and <code>faster</code> hide details. By adding details, an applicant communicates additional business and communication skills. Here are revised examples.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Doubled the application start rate on mobile devices from 500 to 1000 applicants a day with a mobile UI overhaul for job applications in React.</li>
<li>Optimized the CI/CD process resulting in the p90 build time running 10x faster saving ~15 SWE hours a day.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Providing metrics with a baseline to ground the employer and show an applicant's history of quantifying their impact. People also leave out the surrounding project context. Here are examples contextualizing details an applicant may forget.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3a. Led the development of a real time chat feature on a 3 month deadline to secure a customer contract</p>
<p>3b. Led the development of a real time chat feature coordinating changes across 4 teams to secure a customer contract.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same project can showcase different skills with added context. In this case, the applicant's ability to handle time constraints and organizational complexity. Level 3 is met when every line has intent, but do not tell a cohesive story.</p>
<h4>Level 4 - Narratives</h4>
<p>Narratives disqualify jobs which aren't suited for the applicant but make the applicant appealing narrative matches the job. level 4 suits applicants whom desire a specific role. If an employer buckets the applicant into a concise statement when reading a resume, the resume tells an effective narrative. Here are 2 example ideas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New engineer growing fast with full stack engineering chops.</p>
<p>DevOps engineering manager with experience building platform teams from the ground up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every statement in the resume needs to contribute to the final narrative.</p>
<h4>Applying the Levels</h4>
<p>Recently, I've been giving resume feedback to multiple people in various career stages. When reading a resume, I go through each level until the resume fails to meet the criteria. The focus of the feedback depends on the level the resume fails to meet. I've found the framework helpful to give actionable feedback. Not all jobs require level 4 resumes. If I'm applying to be a cashier at McDonalds, I don't need a narrative for how I was born to be a cashier. Like any generalization, it's important to verify if the framework is helpful for the applicants' personal context and goals.</p>
